  ## Installation
  Users will need to install Node.js to run this file, and from there users can use the npm i command to install any other required dependencies

  ## Usage
  This project should be used to generate SVG logos for personal use based on an up to 3 letter identifier, css colors in name or hexadecimal, and a choice of 3 shapes. Users will find this logo automatically generated for them in the same folder as this Javascript file.

  ## How to Contribute
  Users interested in contributing should feel free to make forks of this project. Suggestions of things to work on might be adding different shapes and the ability for users to select their text font. Also, some programmatic way to select a color for the text so it won't clash with the shape would be nice.

  ## Tests
  Users can test this project by opening a node.js terminal on the lib folder and running
  ```
  npm test
  ```
  which will run a test file called shapes.test.js and show that the constructors and setter functions data validate and the render functions return correct SVG text.
