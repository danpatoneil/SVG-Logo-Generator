  ## Installation
  Users will need to install Node.js to run this file, and from there users can use the npm i command to install any other required dependencies

  ## Usage
  This project should be used to generate SVG logos for personal use based on an up to 3 letter identifier, css colors in name or hexadecimal for the shape and the text, and a choice of 3 shapes. Users will find this logo automatically generated for them in the same folder as this Javascript file. [Here is a video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eqlqHLpGZ8Onr-M4dZl1EeXhOPsz42MD/view) of the project working as intended.

  ## How to Contribute
  Users interested in contributing should feel free to make forks of this project. The purpose of this project is relatively narrow but it could be improved to allow users to have more robust options. First and foremost the project would benefit from more shapes, as the 3 listed are relatively narrow and rarely carry any sort of meaning. Another avenue of improvement might be to allow users to exercise more control over the text in the logo, including text size, text placement, and font. Finally, it might be worthwhile to allow users to provide the link to an image to serve as the background for users that want a logo with more character or texture than a what the SVG currently provides (I was unable to find if this was possible with SVG's natively).

  ## Tests
  Users can test this project by opening a node.js terminal on the lib folder and running
  ```
  npm test
  ```
  which will run a test file called shapes.test.js and show that the constructors and setter functions data validate and the render functions return correct SVG text.
